# üè† IBI Home Test

I wasn‚Äôt able to fully complete the assignment regarding showing favorite products with Room due to some onClick issues you may have noticed.  
Hope you enjoy reviewing the work I did manage to complete. (but it does save to the db :) )

## üöÄ Project Architecture

The app uses **two separate activities**:
- `LoginActivity` for handling all authentication and biometric logic
- `MainActivity` for displaying the app content with bottom navigation

This was done intentionally for **security purposes** (avoiding unauthorized access to the main app via back navigation) and to maintain **separation of concerns** between the login flow and the rest of the application.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Login with biometric support** (Fingerprint)
- **Bottom navigation** with 3 sections:
  - **Products List**
  - **Favorites**
  - **Settings**
- **Products List** loaded from [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/)
- **Product Details** page with image, title, description, and price
- **Favorites toggle** using local Room database (in progress)
- **Dark/Light mode toggle** in settings
